<summary><h2>Exercise 2.1: Getting Started with Django</h2></summary>
 
While the previous achievement built a command-line version of a recipe app, this achievement will redevelop the app using the Django framework.
This exercise explores the basics and installation process of Django.

Django is a high-level Python web framework that simplifies the process of building web applications by providing a set of tools and conventions for various web development tasks. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which Django refers to as Model-View-Template (MVT):

- Models (M): In Django, models are Python classes that define the structure of your database tables. Each model class represents a table, and its attributes represent the columns of the table. Models define the data structure and can include fields, relationships, and methods for data manipulation.

- Views (V): Views handle the presentation logic and interact with the user. In the context of Django, views are Python functions or classes that process HTTP requests and return HTTP responses. They decide what data to display and how it should be displayed.

- Templates (T): Templates provide the HTML structure for your web pages. They separate the presentation layer from the logic in views. Django's template engine allows you to insert dynamic data into your HTML templates.
